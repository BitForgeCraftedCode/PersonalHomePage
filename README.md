Custom home page for your browser

For my first official project on GitHub I had a simple but useful idea; create an awesome home page for any internet browser. Currently it has some links on the left with their respective icons and three search bars: DuckDuckGo, Google, and Bing. The home page also scrolls through a set of images the user places in the image folder. There are also some control buttons on the bottom of the page to allow the user to stop the slideshow on any image, scroll images back and forward manually, and a reload button to start the slide show over again. 
Plans for further development include:
1.	Experiment with animated text (scrolling/animated quote of the day)
2.	Add a second page for quick access to more links.
3.	Add some more functionality to the slideshow (new mode for random image slideshow) currently it only starts and stops on a random image. I would like to add a toggle to have it randomly scroll through the images.
4.	Add input for the user to control the time delay for the slideshow.

Notes:
1.	Path names in the slideShow.js file may have to be changed to get this to work on your pc.
2.	You will have to hard code the number of images in your images/wallpaper folder into the JavaScript file. Also, to the best of my knowledge JavaScript cannot dynamically modify folders on your system to pull out image quantities and names so I have forced the naming of images to be wp_1.jpg through wp_x.jpg (where x is the number of images in your folder).
3.	I only include five pictures I took while hiking. Feel free to add tons of your own.
4.	I sized the icons to 52px X 52px and the control buttons were sized to 30px X 30px.
5.	Feel free to use and modify this code for any use and or join the project. 
6.	I build this to demonstrate a solid understanding of basic JavaScript functions, scope, and time-controlled loops.  Enjoy
